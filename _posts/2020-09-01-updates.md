Hello everyone, hope all is well! I have just updated this site for the new academic year, including adding downloadable versions of my recent papers, a link to my CHI presentation on the SIGCHI YouTube channel, and some recent creative work. 

I am also honored to announce that I have been accepted as a Mavis Future Faculty Fellow for this academic year! I look forward to taking part in the program.
