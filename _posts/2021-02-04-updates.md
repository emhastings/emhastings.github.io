Hi all, hope everyone is staying safe and healthy as we start a new semester! I have just updated this site for the new term, including adding information about my new teaching assistantship, reviewing, and some recent creative work. 

I am also honored to share that I was selected to participate in the EECS Rising Stars 2020 workshop at the end of last year! It was a great experience and an honor to be chosen.
