I made this matching smock and coif after finding a beautiful piece of pre-embroidered cotton fabric similar to Elizabethan blackwork for $1 secondhand.  

For the smock, the upper body, sleeves, cuffs, collar, and ruffles were cut from the pre-embroidered fabric, and the remaining pieces from linen left over from [prior projects](https://emhastings.github.io/costuming/faire/). With the exception of the collar and cuffs, the pieces were hemmed by machine and then assembled by hand using an insertion stitch worked in black crochet thread.  

The coif was cut from the embroidered fabric and sewn by hand. Its ties are made from black and white crochet thread. The matching forehead cloth was handsewn from the leftover linen and has ribbon ties.
