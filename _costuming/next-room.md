I built this bodice in 2014 for Mrs. Givings in Knox's production of Sarah Ruhl's _In the Next Room, or the Vibrator Play_. It was designed by [Hannah Compton](https://www.hannahcomptondesign.com/) for the production.

I also built a pair of [combinations](https://www.google.com/search?q=combination+edwardian&rlz=1C1GCEV_en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL9aizw7jjAhXRAp0JHQuBBI4Q_AUIESgC&biw=1536&bih=722&dpr=1.25) for the show, for Mrs. Daldry if I remember correctly.
