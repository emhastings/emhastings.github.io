I made this dress and removeable belt based on McCall's pattern M6557 to emulate an extant dress (see last image). The petticoat is based on [this tutorial by The Sewing Lab](http://www.thesewinglab.net/2012/08/tutorial-petticoat.html). The outfit was started in the costume shop in roughly 2014-2015, and finished in 2020. I attempted a 50s-inspired makeup look to wear with the dress.
