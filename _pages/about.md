I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, currently teaching CS 145: Programming for New Programmers and CS 335: Algorithms. My research addresses the technical, design, and social challenges of algorithmically grouping students into effective teams given different learning goals and at scale, and brings new innovations to the problem of algorithmic team formation. I have published papers at top-tier human-computer interaction and CS education conferences, as well as in the area of prognostics and system health management. Beyond this work, I am also interested in creativity support, e-textiles, and digital humanities.


I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2023 at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, studying Human-Computer Interaction with Professors [Brian Bailey](http://orchid.cs.illinois.edu/people/bailey/index.html) and [Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html). I earned my M.S. in CS along the way in 2019. I was a [Mavis Future Faculty Fellow](https://publish.illinois.edu/engr-mavis/) for the 2020-2021 academic year, and formerly a [Graduate Measurement Science and Engineering Fellow](https://www.nist.gov/iaao/academic-affairs-office/nist-graduate-student-measurement-science-and-engineering-gmse) with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, working with [Michael Brundage](https://www.arlis.umd.edu/about-arlis/our-people/michael-brundage), [Thurston Sexton](https://www.nist.gov/people/thurston-sexton), and the [Knowledge Extraction and Application team](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Knowledge-Extraction-and-Application-for-Smart-Manufacturing) in NIST's Engineering Laboratory.

I previously earned my B.A. summa cum laude from Knox College in Galesburg, IL with a major in Computer Science and a self-designed minor in Renaissance and Medieval Studies. I have always been interested in both fields, and in addition to my current research, I am particularly excited about projects that combine the two areas.

When not doing research, I [design knitwear](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/emily-hastings) and run a craft business, [Realms of Legend](https://realmsoflegend.etsy.com), for which I create handmade items inspired by fantasy and sci-fi series that I love, as well as past eras of our own world. I also enjoy making things for myself and my family, playing/watching video games, and taking care of a growing army of houseplants.
