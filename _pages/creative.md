Check out my creative work below. I have been making things my entire life, and have been selling some of them [on Etsy](https://realmsoflegend.etsy.com) since 2010. I also design knitting and crochet patterns, which you can find [on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/emily-hastings) or in my Etsy shop. Once upon a time, I wrote a blog for my shop, which you can [check out](http://realmsoflegend.blogspot.com/) if you want a behind-the-scenes look at some of my projects.

You can help me make more cool things by supporting me on Ko-fi: <script type='text/javascript' src='https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Support Me on Ko-fi', '#6B8187', 'C0C1P0Z6');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>
