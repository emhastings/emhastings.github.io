I painted this as a birthday gift for a friend, based on a photo she took of our favorite Renaissance faire knights, [Sir Edgeron of Aquataine](https://www.facebook.com/SirEdgeron/) and [Sir Maxmillian, the Jousting Earl of Braden](https://www.facebook.com/SirMaxmillianTheJouster/) of [The Jousters](https://www.facebook.com/TheJousters).
