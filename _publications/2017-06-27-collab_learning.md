title: "Learning Theory Exegesis: Collaborative Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-06-27-collab_learning
excerpt: 'Teamwork has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more and more workplaces expecting their employees to work collaboratively with each other. In response, organizations like the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology have increasingly required educational institutions to incorporate teamwork into their curricula, and a collaborative approach to learning has grown in popularity (Ruiz Ulloa &amp; Adams, 2004).  Like many students, I have always been a little wary of group work, having had bad experiences in the past. I have, however, had positive ones as well; there are a number of benefits to working collaboratively, including a shared (and so perhaps reduced) workload, exposure to different viewpoints, and the ability to take on larger projects. I am, therefore, interested in studying the theory behind collaborative learning, as I hope to one day help my own students experience the positive aspects of group learning while avoiding the negative ones. This topic is also closely related to my current projects for my Ph.D., a point to which I will return later.'
