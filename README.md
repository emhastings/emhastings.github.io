Thanks to @iyeraravind for the flexgallery include (https://github.com/iyeraravind/aravind-website/blob/master/_includes/flexgallery).

TODO:
* Creative
  * Punchneedle, cross-stitch, weaving, spinning?
* Mentoring on CV? (Simran, Vidushi, Jared? Maybe just start as professor)
* Fix IJPHM paper link (download okay so not urgent)


*Update CV doc on page, LinkedIn, etc.
