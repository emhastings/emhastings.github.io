This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles of computer science focusing on problem solving and abstraction techniques. Students will learn to break down problems and specify solutions at a level of detail that lets them be executed by a machine. Specific concepts taught include control structures, data types, and object-oriented design. The course is currently taught using Java. Prerequisites: MATH 109 or concurrent, or placement into MATH 111, 112, 113, 114 or 215. Computer science majors must take concurrently with CS 146. Cannot earn credit in both CS 145 and CS 148.

Course Objectives
- Students should be able to design and implement Java programs that adhere to industry standards and best practices.
- Students should be able to criticize design and implementation choices in collections of software.
- Students should be able to defend the design and implantation choices they make when developing software.
