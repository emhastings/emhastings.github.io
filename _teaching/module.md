excerpt: "This learning module is intended to be an introduction to computer science suitable for K-12 students, along the same lines as the Girls Who Code program, or a summer “College for Kids” course, though it would be equally applicable to beginning undergraduate students in their first computer science course. It provides an overview of what computer science is and what computer scientists do, an introduction to four key concepts of CS (loops, variables, conditionals, and functions), and suggestions for next steps students can take to continue their journey learning CS."
